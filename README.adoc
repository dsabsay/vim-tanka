= vim-tanka

Allows you to more easily navigate Jsonnet libraries when using https://tanka.dev/[Tanka].

It's quite simple.
Open the `main.jsonnet` of the Tanka environment you want to work with.
Then run `:TankaSetEnv`.

Now you can put your cursor on an import filename and type `gf` to jump to that file. You can also use `:find`/`:sfind`. Tanka's https://tanka.dev/libraries/import-paths[import path precedence rules] are honored.

`'makeprg'` and `'errorformat'` are also set appropriately so that the normal compile/quickfix workflow works as expected with `:make` or whatever wrapper you use on top of it. I like `:Make` with https://github.com/tpope/vim-dispatch[vim-dispatch].

Install in whatever way you like.
With https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug[vim-plug], for example:

    Plug 'dsabsay/vim-tanka'

= vim-tanka

Allows you to more easily navigate Jsonnet libraries when using https://tanka.dev/[Tanka].

It's quite simple.
Open the `main.jsonnet` of the Tanka environment you want to work with.
Then run `:TankaSetEnv`.

Now you can put your cursor on an import filename and type `gf` to jump to that file. You can also use `:find`/`:sfind`. Tanka's https://tanka.dev/libraries/import-paths[import path precedence rules] are honored.

For details, see `xref:doc/tanka.txt[:h tanka]`.

== Develop

=== Tight feedback cycle

My `.vimrc` adds this repository to `runtimepath`.
A process that works is:

. Edit `ftplugin/jsonnet.vim`
. Re-open a Jsonnet file
. Script is re-sourced

== Design

=== Feature goals

==== First version

* [x] Show current _context_ of plugin (i.e. Tanka environment `baseDir`).
This should be a statusline thing or something.
* [ ] Jump to file in import statement, using proper path searching rules.
See https://tanka.dev/libraries/import-paths
* [ ] Search for word under cursor in all imported files (for current _context_)
* [ ] Document how to add the _context_ to an existing statusline setup (e.g. with arline, powerline, etc.)

==== Later versions

* [ ] Integration of tk/jsonnet errors into quickfix.
Parse error messages, extract line numbers, populate quickfix list.
* [ ] Auto-complete for function arguments (hover tooltip)

== Bugs

* When calling `:TankaSetEnv`, the cursor doesn't stay in the same window.

== Notes

* Checkout the syntastic integration in `vim-jsonnet`: https://github.com/google/vim-jsonnet/pull/1
* Jsonnet AST explorer thing: https://github.com/fkling/astexplorer/pull/505
* https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep
